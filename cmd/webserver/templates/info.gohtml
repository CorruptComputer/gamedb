                <h5>Why did I make Game DB?</h5>
                <p>Game DB was created as a way to learn certain technologies involved in making websites and goes back to 2015. Originally it was to track players and rank them.
                    Then I started to track other bits of information that the <a href="/steam-api">Steam APIs</a> gave.
                    Then started to track as much as I could, all to display in a friendly manner for gamers.</p>

                <h5 id="trend-score">How is the app trend value calculated</h5>
                <p>The algorithm is taken from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49604913/472084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this post</a> and is likely to change.</p>

                <h5>Why is a player missing?</h5>
                <p>Game DB only knows about players that are added manually. If you are missing, you can add your profile or login to do it automatically.</p>

                <h5>Why does a player have no rank?</h5>
                <p>
                    Ranks get updated daily, so please check back tomorrow. If it has been longer, it may be because your privacy settings stop us from seeing your information.
                    You can allow access by updating your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings">privacy settings</a>.
                </p>

                <h5>How are Twitch streamers calculated</h5>
                <p>Only the viewers from the top 100 streamers are included in the counts on Game DB.</p>

                <h5 id="app-scores">How are app scores calculated?</h5>
                <p>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Additive Smoothing</a></p>
