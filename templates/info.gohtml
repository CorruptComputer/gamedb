                    <h5>I can not find a player</h5>
                    <p>We only find out about players when they get searched for or via a friend already in our database.</p>

                    <h5>A player exists but does not have a rank</h5>
                    <p>Ranks are not live and get calculated at midnight (GMT), so new players may not have a rank right away.
                        <br/>We may not have access to your stats, you can allow access by updating your
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings">privacy settings</a>.</p>

                    <h5>How can I help out?</h5>
                    <p>Programmers can submit
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gamedb/website">pull requests</a>.
                        <a href="/donate">Donations</a> are always welome for everyone else.</p>

                    <h5>How do we gather user data?</h5>
                    <p>Steam has dozens of APIs we can call to get data from them. Everything on Game DB is also availible using the steam app.</p>

                    <h5>I found a website bug</h5>
                    <p>Please file an issue on
                        <a href="https://github.com/gamedb/website/issues/new">GitHub</a>. Or
